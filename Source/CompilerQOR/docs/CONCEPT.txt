CompilerQOR

Provides host compiler abstraction, i.e. makes the code work with lots of different Compilers

Provides Compiler generic definitions and preprocessor macros
Provides Compiler introspection, the code knows which compiler it was built with. The preprocessor knows what features the Compiler has and does not have.
Provides an updated version of the Boost Preprocessor library


All standards variations, special features, missing features and compiler specific items such as warnings and pragmas should be covered here.
While it is not possible to make all Compilers behave the same or to add features to old Compilers that don't have them it is possible to provide a high level of code adaptation so that a wide range of Compilers can access almost all of the QOR code.

All Strata-1 code must be available to all supported Compilers ergo for a Compiler to be supported it must build all Strata-1 code.

CompilerQOR is built as a shared library in modular builds and as part of the single shared library in monolithic builds.

CompilerQOR is intended to be complete at Strata-1 however this may change to Strata-2 if pre-processor based build script generation is introduced
Compiler specific parsing of build logs for Code Coverage may also require CompilerQOR to be developed at Strata-2 or even Strata-3.

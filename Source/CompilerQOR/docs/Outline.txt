CompilerQOR

CompilerQOR is a shared library (.dll/.so) in modular builds and part of the unified shared library in monolithic builds
CompilerQOR is platform (OS, Architecture) independent
CompilerQOR provides abstraction of the host compiler, its capabilities and features.

You do not normally need to link your applications or libraries against CompilerQOR but you can if you need
access to Compiler intrinsic functions

CompilerQOR is available in reduced but usable form at Strata-1. It is intended to be complete at Strata-2.
If CompilerQOR is available at Strata-2 always use the Strata-2 or above builds as Strata1 may contain broken
or incomplete implementations only sufficient to meets Strata-1 requirements.

CompilerQOR also provides the QOR Preprocessor and Build Gen libraries as header only libraries.
The QOR Preprocessor library is a development of the Boost Preprocessor library. 
Build Gen is a preprocessor build script generator which leverages the power of the preprocessor library.

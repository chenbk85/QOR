stdQOR - The QOR standard library

The QOR standard C++ library is intended to be a minimally changed port of the LLVM/clang/libc++ project. 
This project is at the time of writing the newest and most easily ported standard library implementation. 
It will continue to be at the cutting edge of C++ through C++14 while hopefully 
maintaining a high degree of backward compatability. While the QOR cannot simply use libc++ out of the 
box until and unless the QOR becomes a target platform of the the libc++ project itself we can incorporate
it with minimal changes.

Over time the QOR implementation may diverge from the LLVM implementation in order to maintain compatability
with the set of already qualified compilers.

stdQOR builds as a shared library in modular builds and as part of the single shared library in monolithic builds

stdQOR is intended to be complete at Strata-3

SystemQOR

SystemQOR is a shared library (.dll/.so) in modular builds and part of the unified shared library in monolithic builds
SystemQOR is platform (Compiler, OS, architecture) independent
SystemQOR provides an operating system abstraction for functionality which falls outside Posix

You can link your portable application or library to SystemQOR

SystemQOR is available in reduced forms at Strata-1 and Strata-2. It is intended to be complete at Strata-3.
If SystemQOR is available at Strata-3 always use the Strata-3 or above builds as Strata1-2 may contain broken
or incomplete implementations only sufficient to meets their requirements.

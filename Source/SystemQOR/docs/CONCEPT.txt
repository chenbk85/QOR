SystemQOR - The Operating System Abstraction library

SystemQOR will provide a generic interface onto the System, its functionality and facilities, its capabilities, version, parameters, options and events.

This interface may be used by application developers but is intended rather for use by generic QOR components that wish to interact with the Operating 
System but do not want to care which Operating System it is they are interacting with.

The SystemQOR will contain the platform specific implementation of the Posix interface for use by the CQOR interface library. 
This implementation will also be available to other system specific code which may call it rather than routing calls through the generic wrapper.

The additional functionality exposed will be that which is not covered by the Posix specification and cannot therefore be accessed via CQOR or PosumQOR.
It will also be functionality that is not specific to any platform specialized backend portion of a particular QOR module .

The SystemQOR folder within the project will contain not just the code for the SystemQOR library itself but all the system specific backends of QOR
components and any and all other Operating System specific code such as Bootstraps and library loaders.

Note: No Operating System dependent code should exist anywhere in the QOR outside of the SystemQOR folder and there should be no operating System specific 
types required to use the SystemQOR interface itself.

SystemQOR builds as a shared library in modular builds and as part of the single shared library in monolithic builds.

SystemQOR is intended to be complete at Strata-3

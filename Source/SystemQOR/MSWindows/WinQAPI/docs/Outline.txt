WinQAPI

WinQAPI is a shared library (.dll) in modular builds and part of the unified shared library in monolithic builds
WinQAPI is Microsoft Windows specific
WinQAPI is a thin wrapper providing additional debugging and result checks over the Microsoft Windows Win32 API.

You do not need to link WinQAPI into your applications or libraries. It is automatically loaded as part of the QOR on Windows

WinQAPI is available in reduced forms at Strata-1 and Strata-2. It is intended to be complete at Strata-3.
If WinQAPI is available at Strata-3 always use the Strata-3 or above builds as Strata1-2 may contain broken

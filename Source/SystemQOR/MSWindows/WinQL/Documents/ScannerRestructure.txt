Derive the base scanner class from IScanner
Extend ICamera/IScanner so that the interface it mandates covers all the activity of the scanner
Separate the Notifcation manager for Library level notifications from the per scanner callback interface IScannerObserver 
IScannerObserver will manage the majority of the current notifications and be implemented directly on the CQtScannerProxy
Library notifications will be raised on the Detection thread and all others on scanner specific threads avoiding lock contention

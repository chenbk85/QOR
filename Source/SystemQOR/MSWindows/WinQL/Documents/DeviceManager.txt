//Device Manager

Enumerators need a local list to hold Device Instances if they're going to own them as now.
Need to make chldren of a device instance available as a device list if we're not going to forcibly enumerate everything.

This will mean making each instance into a 'list' of its children or having it contain the list thus merging the enumerator and instance type hierarchies.

System().Keyboards[ n ] | System().Keyboard == System.Keyboards[ 0 ]

CKeyboard --|> CSharedKeyboard --|> CKeyboardDevice --|> CDeviceInterface
					|											|-* CIODeviceFile
					|											|-> CDeviceInstance
					|												|- CDeviceInstanceModel
					|
					|- CKeyboardLayouts --* CKeyboardLayoutIterator --< CKeyboardLayout
					|														|- CKeyboardLayoutHandle
					|- CHotKeys --|> CTArray< CHotKey >

Keyboard devices, those with GUID_DEVINTERFACE_KEYBOARD will need to be enumerated when System().Keyboards is constructed on access.
For each keyboard a structure as above will be created referencing the CDeviceInstance already owned by its enumerator.
The CSharedKeyboard will provide an interface to get a CKeyboardDeviceSession. This will provide the low level device specific IO controls from C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\inc\api\ntddkbd.h to query indicators etc

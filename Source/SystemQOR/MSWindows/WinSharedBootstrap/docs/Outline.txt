WinSharedBootstrap

WinSharedBootstrap is a static library in modular builds and part of the unified shared library in monolithic builds
WinSharedBootstrap is Microsoft Windows specific
WinSharedBootstrap provides the entry point, startup and termination code for Windows shared libraries (.dll)
WinSharedBootstrap is linked into all QOR Framework Dlls and Framework extension Dlls for Windows
WinSharedBootstrap is intended to support 32bit and 64bit Dll builds
WinSharedBootstrap is intended to support ANSI and UNICODE Dll builds
WinSharedBootstrap belongs entirely in Strata-1. There are no plans to add anything to it above Strata-1.

You do not need to link WinSharedBootstrap into your application (.exe) to use the QOR.
You will however need to link it into any Dll you write to extend the QOR.

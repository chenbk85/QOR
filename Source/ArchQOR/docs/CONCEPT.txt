ArchQOR

Architecture abstraction Module

To provide as consistent as possible an interface to the target CPU.
To provide a JIT assembler for creating target specific assembly level routines at runtime.
To provide a High level JIT assembler for creating functions at runtime.

The JIT assembler to support performance, adaptation to special or advanced hardware and low level intrinsic function support replacing compiler specific proprietory source.

ArchQOR builds as a shared library in modular builds and as part of the single shared library in monolithic builds.

ArchQOR is intended to be complete at Strata-2

Strata-1 Stub code is in place. In looks like we'll need to extend it slightly otherwise we can't make the 
necessary distinction between 32bit and 64bit targets for the OS specific libraries.

Strata-2
x86 support and a good deal of x64 support is implemented. JIT assembler ported from the AsmJIT project.
TODO:
The High level assembler design needs to be refactored to remove the separate intrinsics class
Target feature requirement specification is needed so we can target specific x86 feature sets
Host feature testing for meeting requirements is needed on top of the host feature reporting already done.
A lot of code needs to be moved out of header inlines.
Extensive tests are needed to exercise the low level and high level assemblers. 
We need a real world assembly language project to port into Jit Asm to really show it working.
ARM support is clearly the next big step. 
Consider farming this out as a student project. The original x86 assembler was done as a GSoC project so an ARM equivalent should be plausible if pitched at the right level.

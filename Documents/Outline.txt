CQOR

CQOR is a shared library (.dll/.so) in modular builds and part of the unified shared library in monolithic builds
CQOR is platform (Compiler, OS, Architecture) independent
CQOR provides an implementation of the 'C' standard library

You can link your portable application or library to CQOR

CQOR is available in reduced forms at Strata-1 and Strata-2. It is intended to be complete at Strata-3.
If CQOR is available at Strata-3 always use the Strata-3 or above builds as Strata1-2 may contain broken
or incomplete implementations only sufficient to meets their requirements.

CQOR is thin standards compliance wrapper over platform specific and multiplatform implementations.

On Microsoft Windows all C library implementations are dependent on and implemented in terms of the underlying
API therefore new Windows specific code should avoid use of the C library to maximize performnce.
This is true whether the QOR is used or not. It is recommended to use the QOR Posum library on Windows
as a portable and performant alternative. The CQOR on Windows is implemented largely in terms
of Posum. On Other platforms Posum is implemented in terms of the CQOR.
